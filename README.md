# MOOC-Data-Science-and-ML-Python
This repository regroups all the exercices and projects I've done during this course in order to improve my computing science skills especially in Data Science and Machine Learning

Install
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Seaborn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
